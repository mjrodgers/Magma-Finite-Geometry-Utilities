# MagmaFiniteGeometry

Adds some functionality to the Magma Computer Algebra System, mostly geared towards applications in finite geometry.

There are in particular some intrinsics to use for building incidence matrices and creating tactical decomposition matrices of incidence structures, as well as some tools for isomorphism testing of certain combinatorial objects.
